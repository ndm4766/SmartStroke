Norm Comparison/Graphs
=======================

When first navigating to the Norm Comparison page, a loading ring will display showing that the data is being loaded and calculated to be displayed on the graphs. By default, Trails A vertical test data will be displayed along with for all age groups, all education levels, along with the mean and median plots. The Normative Data graphs will graph all normative data for Trails A & B separately. In addition to the normal Trails A & B tests, we also include the option to graph horizontal versisons of Trails A & B. To switch between which type of test to graph, select the dropdown box below the Options button to select which test you would like to graph. 

The Options button wil display a popup menu with several options on how to display the graphs. There are 2 dropdown boxes for Time Range. This sets the range of test times to be displayed on the graph. There is no specific order on the dropdown boxes. The left or right box can be either the minimum or maximum for the time range. There are also 2 dropdown boxes for the Age Range. This sets the range of test times by the ages of the subjects to be displayed on the graph. There is no specific order on the dropdown boxes. The left or right box can be either the minimum or maximum for the age range. The age range minimum is 18, anything below that will be displayed in the age group of -1 to signify an error in the data. This can happen if a subject is youger than 18 or if they failed to properly select a birthdate when being added. There are checkboxes for each level of education to be graphed. If an education level is checkmarked, then subjects of that education level will be included in the graphical display of the normative data. Unchecking a box will refresh the graph that does not include subjects with that education level. There are also checkboxes for male and female, these do the same thing as the education level checkboxes except based on gender. Finally, there are 2 more checkboxes, for displaying a line graph for the mean and median. Unchecking these boxes will remove the respective line graph.  

Time Elapsed View

In order to see how time elapsed while the patient took the test, select an already taken test from the replay menu. Then hit the time elapsed button.
